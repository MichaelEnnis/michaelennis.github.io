The company was originally called doorbot and Siminoff presented his idea on on the TV show Shark Tank in 2013. He asked for $700,000 for 10% of his companing, which at the time was valued around seven million dollars. The Sharks didn't accept Siminoff's offer and he left without a deal. However, things eventually worked out for Siminoff, as his company continued to grow and was later bought by Amazon in 2018 for around $800 million. Before they were bought by Amazon though, they went under a serious rebranding. Their opriginal name Doorbot was thought to be too "techie" and the company wanted to rebrand to something they thought would be fun, aswell as fit their mission statement "To reduce crime in communities". One of the reasons they chose the name Ring was to symbolize the ring of security their systems created around their users homes.
