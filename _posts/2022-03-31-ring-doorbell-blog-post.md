## Internet of Things Security: The Ring Doorbell 
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50071378/161210894-21c6a8f0-fdcf-4dbd-a57c-c4167c00fa75.png)


Have you ever wanted to see who is at your door without closing one eye and peering through the tiny peephole in your front door? Or perhaps you want 24/7 home surveillance for security purposes? These are just a few of the reasons why someone might be interested in a Ring doorbell. However, what if you weren't the only one watching and listening to these cameras? This is one of the many security threats that are possible with the new wave of cloud-based security cameras, such as the Ring doorbell.

# What is the Ring doorbell?

The Ring doorbell is a popular internet of things (IoT) device that allows its user 24/7 access to a live video and audio feed. The doorbell is usually powered by a wired source, usually, the same one that your "old-fashioned" doorbell system would be connected to (although some models do have a battery). Most models of the Ring doorbell support two-way talk, a live video feed, and cloud recording. This is all done via either Ring's web or mobile app. You will also need a monthly or yearly subscription to one of Ring's protect plans. Although it may sound convenient for the average homeowner to allow Ring to completely manage the system, this is where the potential security issues come into play.

# The rise of Ring

Ring started as an idea by Jamie Siminoff in his garage in late 2011. His idea was to create a doorbell that would provide security to its users with its always-on camera and audio feed. The company was originally called Doorbot and Siminoff presented his idea on the TV show Shark Tank in 2013. He asked for $700,000 for 10% of his company, which at the time was valued around seven million dollars. The Sharks didn't accept Siminoff's offer and he left without a deal. However, things eventually worked out for Siminoff, as his company continued to grow and was later bought by Amazon in 2018 for around $800 million. Before they were bought by Amazon though, they went under a serious rebranding. Its original name of Doorbot was thought to be too "techie" and the company wanted to rebrand to something they thought would be fun, as well as fit their mission statement "To reduce crime in communities". One of the reasons they chose the name Ring was to symbolize the ring of security their systems created around their users' homes. Ring has only become more dominant in the video doorbell industry, selling 1.4 million units in 2020 alone according to Strategy Analytics. However, The rise in popularity of the Ring doorbell has also come with a rise in attempts by hackers to invade these systems.

# The security of Ring

The ring doorbell ecosystem may sound very appealing to homeowners, but it doesn't come without risk. Since the video doorbell is connected to your home's internet via wifi, it is very susceptible to being hacked. According to Cnet, in 2016 a security research company called Pen Ten Partners found a vital flaw in the Ring doorbell system that would allow hackers to steal Wi-Fi passwords from unsuspecting homeowners. There was also another example of Ring's poor security when a security firm Dojo Bullguard hacked a Ring doorbell in real-time at the Mobile World Congress. Ring originally sent this sensitive data over an unencrypted network, which allowed anyone with range of your home's Wi-Fi to tap into your doorbell during the initial setup. Although most of these vulnerabilities have been quickly fixed by Ring when they are discovered, it is clear that the system is not foolproof and poses a potential security threat to your home network.

Another potential security issue for consumers is Ring's partnership with law enforcement. In 2018, the Amazon-owned company started partnering with local law enforcement to survey neighborhoods for potential thieves or other criminal activity. This was built upon the app that Ring had launched earlier in May called Neighbors which allowed users to upload clips from their doorbell to a social network where other people in their neighborhood could access them. This was generally well accepted by Ring's users because they voluntarily provided these clips to show to their neighbors. However, many customers had a problem with police officers having access to these same sorts of clips, without their consent. The partnership was also very profitable for Ring as many cities started providing Ring discounts to residents to increase the reach of their surveillance. There is a [Google map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1eYVDPh5itXq5acDT9b0BVeQwmESBa4cB) that shows every partnership between public safety agencies and Ring that shows just how widespread this partnership is.

Although it is one thing for a hacker or law enforcement to view the outside of your house without you knowing, it is a much scarier thought when they can see _inside_ your home. Ring is primarily known for its video doorbells, but they also sell full home security systems that allow you to monitor what is happening inside of your home as well. This may not sound like a big deal for the average consumer, but once you know Ring's history with security and the numerous vulnerabilities they have had with their systems in the past, you start to see how this can become a big problem. In this video from TODAY, you can see multiple examples of a hacker using the indoor video camera's two-way talk feature to communicate with their victims. Ring claimed that these attacks were not due to a fault in their security system, but rather the fault of the consumer for not properly securing their network and accounts. However, for a company targetting a wide consumer base that might not have a ton of technical experience, more of the responsibility should be placed on them to keep their products secure.

# Should you install a Ring doorbell in your home?

In this blog post here I have detailed the rise of the Ring doorbell and the potential security issues that arise from these systems. Hopefully, this post has enlightened you to the potential risks that are associated with allowing this system to be a part of your home. I think it is up to each person to decide whether installing a Ring doorbell (or any IoT security camera for that matter) is right for them and their families. Although I can see the positives of having a video doorbell on your front door and I think the benefits outweigh the risks, I don't think the same can be said for indoor video cameras. The possibility of a hacker being able to record and watch you inside of your own house is not something I think many consumers would be comfortable with, no matter how secure Ring tries to make their product.
