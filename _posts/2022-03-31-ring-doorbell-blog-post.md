Have you ever wanted to see who is at your door without closing one eye and peering through the tiny peephole in your front door? Or perhaps you want 24/7 home surviellance for security purposes? These are just a few of the reasons why someone might be interested in a Ring doorbell. However, what if you weren't the only one watching and listening to these cameras? This is one of the many security threats that are possible with the new wave of cloud-based security cameras, such as the Ring doorbell.

# What is the Ring doorbell?

The Ring doorbell is a popular internet of things (IoT) device that allows it's user 24/7 access to a live video and audio feed. The doorbell is usually powered by a wired source, usually the same one that your "old-fashioned" doorbell system would be connected to (although some models do have a battery). Most models of the Ring doorbell support two-way talk, a live video feed, and cloud recording. This is all done via either Ring's web or mobile app. You will also need a monthly or yearly subscription to one of Ring's protect plans. Although it may sound convient for the average home owner to allow Ring to completely manage the system, this is where the potential security issues come into play.
